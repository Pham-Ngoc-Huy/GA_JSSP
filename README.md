# Solution Presentation

This solution presentation explains the process of encoding and decoding the reading output based on the labels we attach to each sequence. The aim is to create a structured representation of operations and assemblies that can be easily interpreted, modified, and optimized for different manufacturing or assembly line scenarios.

### Example:

| **operation_sequence** | **assembly_sequence** |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| (part, operation)      | part-sequence         |

For example:

**operation_sequence**:  
(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)

**assembly_sequence**:  
1, 2, 3, 4

### Array for Solution Presentation Sample:
`[(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### Encoding Process

1. **Input Representation**: The first step is representing the input as a sequence of operations and assemblies. The **operation sequence** is a tuple of `(part, operation)` where each `(part, operation)` pair represents a step in the production process. The **assembly sequence** is the final sequence of parts in the order in which they are assembled.

2. **Encoding Sequence**: We encode the input sequences into a compact representation (for example, an array or list) that maintains the relationships between operations and assemblies.

3. **Handling Complex Sequences**: If there are dependencies or constraints between operations (e.g., some operations must be done before others), these are encoded into the sequence using appropriate labels or additional flags.

### Decoding Process

1. **Restoring Original Sequence**: The decoding process involves reversing the encoding transformation to restore the original operation and assembly sequences.

2. **Sequence Validation**: The decoder should ensure that the resulting sequences maintain the integrity of the process, i.e., the operations follow the correct order, and the parts are assembled in the correct sequence.

3. **Error Handling**: During decoding, errors may arise, such as missing parts or misaligned operations. The decoder needs to handle these gracefully, possibly by flagging invalid sequences or suggesting corrections.
